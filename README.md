# mern_phase1
Hello.
This is my first foray into MERN; It is a bunny-slope MERN-stack app that uses fetch within a ReactJS Customers component, calling a GET route within ExpressJS API routes to obtain a list of customer documents from the customers collection within a local mongodb database "customers".

I used two main sources to put it together: Corey Gackenheimer's API tutorial on Udemy, and Brad Traversy's create_react_starter.git/YouTube video.
